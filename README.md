# Multidimensional-Scaling-MDS-
This repository contains dataset, code and insights derived from MDS.

The data is survey data collected to identify the differentiating factors for various toothpaste brands. The person who took the survey provided their input on
a 7 point Likert scale.

The notebook contains python code where Non-metric MDS is implemented and the data is collapsed from n-dimensional space to jsut 2-D in order to visualize better.

In the PPT provided, I have included all the insights which are required by the business to make decisions. This was done after a thorough study of various toothpaste
brands and how they position themselves in the market.
